## 🏢 Project Overview 

AtliQ Hardware, a leading manufacturer and distributor of hardware products, is undergoing rapid growth and entering new markets. While the company has successfully transitioned from cluttered Excel sheets to centralized databases, it still lacks a scalable analytics system and dedicated data analytics team to transform raw data into actionable insights.

This gap in advanced analytics recently led to a major setback during the launch of a new store in Latin America. Decisions were based on intuition and limited survey data, resulting in significant financial losses. Additionally, competitors like Dell are leveraging robust analytics teams to make quicker and smarter decisions, leaving AtliQ at a strategic disadvantage.

To support its expansion plans and remain competitive, AtliQ urgently needs to adopt business intelligence tools like Power BI and build a dedicated analytics team to enable data-driven, timely, and strategic decision-making. As a Junior Data Analyst in the Data Analytics Team, I was tasked with creating Power BI dashboards to address this gap.

## 🔬 Techniques & Process Followed

1. **Data Extraction and Transformation**:
   - Retrieved datasets from their respective MySQL databases and csv files.
   - Cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query Editor by removing duplicates, addressing missing values, and standardizing fields to maintain data quality and consistency.
   - Loaded all tables into the data model and established relationships to consolidate the datasets for seamless analysis.


2. **Data Modeling**:
   - [Connected dimension tables and fact tables](https://github.com/SaranEranki/Business-Insights-360-Codebasics-PowerBI/blob/main/BI%20360%20Data%20Model.png) by implementing snowflake schema.
   - Created calculated columns and DAX measures to derive key metrics and enhance data analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Used different visuals and charts to summarize and analyze the data.
   - Applied drill-down and cross-filtering techniques to uncover deeper, hidden relationships within the data.   
   - Utilized aggregation functions, segmentation, and trend analysis for better insights.
   - Leveraged dynamic field parameters and slicers to enable real-time filtering and customized drill-through insights.

4. **Multiple Views**:
   - Organized visuals into separate view pages for various departments to ensure easy navigation and a smoother exploration experience.
   - Incorporated attractive icons for each view page and implemented page navigation actions to enhance user interactivity.


5. **Appealing Design**:
   - Designed reports focusing on business users, making them visually intuitive and easy to understand for non-technical stakeholders.
   - Built a dedicated filter panel to enable seamless self-exploration and improve user experience.
